## Description
Weatheristics is an individual project I worked on for 4 weeks. I was asked to build a weather application. The application shows the weather and sends push-notification if it is about to rain.

## Features
- Be able to get weather information with your location
- Be able to get weather information from our cities
- Be able to send push notifications when it is about to rain or snow


## Installation
You can open the application in Visual Studio Code and run npm install in the root of the project to install all the needed packages.
```
npm install
```

## Credits 
Used libraries:
- [Open Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/api): I used this API to retrieve all the weather data.
