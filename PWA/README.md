# Weatheristics

## Description

Weatheristics is an individual project I worked on for 4 weeks. I was asked to build a weather application. The application shows the weather and sends push-notification if it is about to rain.

I have learned to work with Service Workers and improve my coding skills with HTML, CSS, PHP and JavaScript.
