# Stolpersteine

## Description

Stolpersteine is a group project that was requested by [Stichting 18 September](https://stichting18september.nl/). We were asked to update an outdated web application from Stichting 18 September. 

Stolpersteine are memorial stones that are placed by Stichting 18 September. Their functionality is the help remember the people who died during the Holocaust. The stones are covered in gold, each stone for one victim. The stones are placed at the place where the person has last lived freely. More information can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stolperstein).

I have learned to work with Android Studio and improve my coding skills with Kotlin.
