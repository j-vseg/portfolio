# Accessibilty Plugin

This Flutter plugin is able to gather Accessibility data from iOS and Android. It gathers data from the ScreenReader, VoiceOver, font size and many more. 

## Getting Started
All you need to gather the data is to make an instance to this plugin and call the method 'getAccessibiltyStats()'. This method will return a map with the accessiblity data based on what device and platform you are using.
